# Mental_Health_Dataset_Cleansing
## Summary :
The original dataset was messy, containing several missing, duplicate, and incorrect values, along with some unnecessary columns that werenâ€™t useful for visualization. So, I first cleaned and analyzed the dataset, then exported the cleaned version to a CSV file for visualization in Tableau. I also generated a summary/statistical report using Python, exported it as an HTML file, and finally visualized the cleaned dataset using Tableau.
