# Mental_Health_Dataset_Cleansing
## Summary :
The Original Dataset is Messy Which Contains Several Missing, Duplicate & Wrong values and Contains Some Unnecessary Columns In Terms Of Visualization. So, First I cleaned and Analyze this Dataset and export the cleaned dataset into a CSV File for Visualization on Tableau then prepare a Summary/Statistical Report Using Python and export that report into a Html File and then Finally Visualize the Clean Dataset Using Tableau.
